Stare at me
In your Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out
Like you've been carrying a load
And you swear to me
You don't wanna be my slave
But you're staring at me
Like I...
Like I need to be...
Saved
Saved
Like I need to be...
Saved
Saved

In the Jesus Christ pose
Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the Lord
And I swear to you
That I would never feed you pain
But you're staring at me
Like I...
Like I'm driving the...
Nails
Nails
Like I'm driving the...
Nails
Nails
Like I'm driving the...
Nails
Nails
Nails
Nails
Nails

Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ the light

Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the lord
Would it pay you more to walk on water
Than to wear a crown of thorns
It wouldn't pain me more to bury you fucking rich
Than to bury you poor
Poor
Poor
Poor
