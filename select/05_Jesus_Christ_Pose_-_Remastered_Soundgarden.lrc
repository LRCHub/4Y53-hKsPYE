[01:26.91] And you stare at me
[01:30.47] In your Jesus Christ pose
[01:34.57] Arms held out
[01:37.42] Like you've been carrying a load
[01:41.09] And you swear to me
[01:44.15] You don't wanna be my slave
[01:48.11] But you're staring at me
[02:00.11] 
[01:51.73] Like I
[01:54.41] Like I need to be
[01:56.37] Saved
[01:59.80] Saved
[02:01.59] Like I need to be
[02:03.50] Saved
[02:07.03] Saved
[02:09.53] 
[02:09.74] In your Jesus Christ pose
[02:17.19] In your Jesus Christ pose
[02:29.69] 
[02:38.65] Arms held out
[02:41.84] In your Jesus Christ pose
[02:45.80] Thorns and shroud
[02:48.89] Like it's the coming of the Lord
[02:52.53] And I swear to you
[02:55.69] I would never feed you pain
[02:59.75] But you're staring at me
[03:11.75] 
[03:03.23] Like I
[03:05.82] Like I'm driving the
[03:07.53] Nails
[03:11.19] Nails
[03:12.97] Like I'm driving the
[03:14.76] Nails
[03:18.45] Nails
[03:20.95] 
[03:20.22] Like I'm driving the
[03:21.86] Nails (nails)
[03:23.91] Nails (nails)
[03:25.58] Nails (nails)
[03:27.47] Like I'm driving the
[03:29.29] Nails (nails)
[03:30.85] Nails
[03:33.35] 
[03:35.78] In your Jesus Christ pose
[03:42.63] In your Jesus Christ pose
[03:55.13] 
[04:04.85] Arms held out
[04:07.87] In your Jesus Christ pose
[04:11.71] Thorns and shroud
[04:14.55] Like it's the coming of the lord
[04:18.35] Would it pay you more to walk on water
[04:21.74] Than to wear a crown of thorns?
[04:25.38] It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich
[04:31.75] Than to bury you poor
[04:42.25] 
[04:36.39] In your Jesus Christ pose (poor)
[04:40.52] Poor
[04:43.45] In your Jesus Christ pose
